Windy Autumn:
#T

!T
Autumn.
Walking around the city.
You see very low amount of people...
Ghost city you think ...
Leaves are rustling, the wind is blowing into yo face!
Fucking wind ...
You proceed home slowly.
Without accomplishing anything today...
But who cares!
You are You ...
You don't give a shit about others.
And still proceeding home you feel somewhat refreshed.
